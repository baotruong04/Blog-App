# Testing Guide

### Isolate the Unit:

A unit test should focus on a single, independent unit of code (e.g., a function, a class method). Use mocks, stubs, or fakes to simulate dependencies and ensure the unit's behavior is tested in isolation, without relying on external systems like databases or APIs.


### Fast Execution:
Unit tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback during development. Avoid slow operations or external calls that can hinder test suite performance.


### Self-Validating:
Tests should clearly indicate success or failure without manual intervention. The test output should be unambiguous.

### Repeatable:
Tests should produce the same results every time they are run, regardless of the environment or execution order.

### Timely:
Write unit tests frequently and early in the development process, ideally alongside the code being tested (Test-Driven Development).


### Understandable:
Test code should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, even for someone unfamiliar with the system. Use descriptive test names.

### No Side Effects:
Unit tests should not alter the state of the system or leave behind artifacts that could affect subsequent tests.


### Rules for Writing Integration Tests:

### Test Interactions:
Integration tests verify the interactions and communication between different components or modules of a system, or between the system and external dependencies (e.g., databases, APIs, message queues).
### Realistic Environment:
While unit tests strive for isolation, integration tests often require a more realistic environment, including actual dependencies, to accurately simulate real-world interactions.
### Focus on Interfaces:
Test the interfaces and contracts between components to ensure they work together as expected.
### Manage Dependencies:
Carefully manage and set up the necessary infrastructure and data for integration tests. This might involve creating test databases or configuring external services.
### Consider Performance:
Integration tests are typically slower than unit tests due to their reliance on external systems. Optimize test setup and execution to minimize run times where possible.
### Clear Scope:
Define the scope of each integration test to ensure it focuses on a specific set of interactions.
### Clean Up:
Ensure that integration tests clean up any created data or resources after execution to maintain a consistent test environment.
